<p> These are my two cats, Pan, and Pinto, short for Pan Francisco, and Pinto Bean. <br>
Pinto about 16 years old, which is very old for a cat.  He loves snuggles, and toys with string. <br> 
My other cat,  Pan, is 3 years old and very fat. He loves to play with feather toys, and loves to eat.</p>

<p> In this section, I will cover many of the different cat breeds out there. 
 There are new breeds that are discovered, so my information may not always be up to date.  
 For current breeds that are accepted in cat shows, visit the website of the <a href="http://cfa.org/Breeds.aspx"> Cat Fancier's Association</a>,
 or the <a href="https://www.tica.org/en/cat-breeds"> International Cat Association</a></p>
